This application was built by a group of four during Break Through Tech's 2024 Career Launch program

Inspiration:

We chose our idea because we realize that climate change is one of the most pressing issues that the world faces, and our responsibility as the younger generation is to take charge of this issue and innovate solutions. This application would make lowering carbon footprints into a fun and exciting game, where people can compete against each other for a good cause. We believe that todayâ€™s world needs something that pushes climate solutions into something that is more palatable and realistic for users to actually be able to implement in their everyday lives. Our project is a novel take on combatting climate change.

What it does:

Net-0 is a platform that aims to help users reduce their carbon footprint. It begins with a quiz that contains a series of questions that helps us calculate their total carbon footprint. Based off of this number, a list of daily tasks will be generated to help improve the carbon footprint scores. This app also gives users the opportunity to form groups and compete with others to ultimately reduce our carbon footprint as a whole.

How we built it:

UI/UX: Figma
Front-end: HTML/CSS
Back-end: Python-Flask 
Challenges we ran into
Some challenges that we ran into during this project was learning how to do the backend development. This was our first time doing a project like this and we all focused on different parts of the project. We spent a lot of time experimenting with different softwares and trying to develop a functional application so backend development was a little difficult for us to tackle.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:

We are proud that we were able to come up with the idea of a social-aspect to our project. Our idea was to allow users to be able to join groups so they could compete with others and create more engagement as a whole. And we are proud that we were able to produce a presentable product.

What we learned:

During this project, we learned a lot about app design and how to enhance user engagement. We learned how to use new softwares like python-flask and how to make a web-application with user-authentication. We worked well in a team and were able to put our ideas together to create Net-0.

What's next for Net 0:

Building a mobile app
Improve the existing features that we have and wanted to include
Extend this application to reach a broader range of people
